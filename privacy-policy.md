(iii)	personal information about you from other sources, such as a complaint made about you from a fellow user; and
(iv)	“cookie” based information that makes your use of our Website easier by recording your preferences so that when you return to our Website the “cookie” re-loads that information into your web browser.

(b)	All Customer Data collected in connection with the KIDS CONNECTING PARENTS application is primarily stored in Australia via an Australian cloud provider with infrastructure based in Australia. However, certain services, such as authentication and analytics, may involve processing through Google’s global infrastructure, which could result in data being temporarily stored or processed outside of Australia, including in the United States or other locations. Additionally, while the KIDS CONNECTING PARENTS application itself is hosted in Australia, the Website and any KIDS CONNECTING PARENTS social media sites may be hosted outside of Australia. As a result, data associated with the Website and social media interactions may be transferred to and stored by foreign hosting service providers, including but not limited to those in the United States. You acknowledge and accept that we may transfer any and all Customer Data (including all personal information) overseas to the United States of America or elsewhere as the case may be.
(c)	By submitting your personal information to us, you expressly agree and consent to the disclosure, transfer, storing or processing of your personal information outside of Australia. In providing this consent, you understand and acknowledge that countries outside Australia do not always have the same privacy protection obligations as Australia in relation to personal information. We will take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties securely and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. However, by providing your consent, under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), we are not required to take all steps as may be reasonable in the circumstances.
5.5	How long do we keep your personal information?
